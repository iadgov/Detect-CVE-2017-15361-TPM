# Detect Trusted Platform Modules Vulnerable to CVE-2017-15361 
This repository provides files to aid DoD administrators in detecting Windows systems that have an enabled Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that is vulnerable to CVE-2017-15361. This repository is a companion to Information Assurance Advisory [RSA Key Generation Vulnerability Affecting Trusted Platform Modules](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-advisories-alerts/rsa-key-generation-vulnerability-affecting-trusted-platform.cfm). The files in this repository can be downloaded as a zip file [here](https://github.com/iadgov/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM/archive/master.zip).

The main files of interest in the repository include:
* [windows/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.audit](windows/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.audit) - a Nessus custom audit file useful for DoD administrators who want to scan their network with Nessus (acquire via the [ACAS](https://www.disa.mil/cybersecurity/network-defense/acas) program).
* [windows/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.ps1](windows/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.ps1) - a PowerShell script useful for DoD administrators who want to locally test a single, standalone system.
* [linux/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.audit](linux/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.audit) - a Nessus custom audit file useful for DoD administrators who want to scan the Linux systems on their network with Nessus (acquire via the [ACAS](https://www.disa.mil/cybersecurity/network-defense/acas) program).
* [linux/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.sh](linux/Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.sh) - a bash script useful for DoD users who want to locally test a single, standalone Linux system.



Support files in the repository include:
* [GenerateNessusAuditFile.ps1](windows/GenerateNessusAuditFile.ps1) - a PowerShell script that generates the Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.audit file based on code in the Detect-CVE-2017-15361-TPM.ps1 file.
